Wooba is overjoyed to present a group show inside Merideth Hillbrand's 2015 Honda Fit as part of [Partial Shade](https://partialshade.info/)'s *Transmission* exhibition (a co-production with [CoLab](https://www.co-labprojects.org/)).

The interior of a compact car is totally unlike most of our other interiors.
