A lady in a cafe complimented the sticker of a fly on my laptop and asked me where she could get one. I said that my friend made it. She was impressed and said she wanted one, but then upon closer inspection was disappointed to find out it was a fly and not a butterfly. I told her hey, flies need love to. She said indeed they do but she has trouble forming emotional bonds with flies; they buzz loudly and move about too suddenly, always appearing in your home as uninvited guests. I told her I can kinda relate to the fly. She told me she prefers mosquitos, theyâ€™re easier to kill.
